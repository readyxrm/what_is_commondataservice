The Common Data Service (CDS) is a powerful feature of the Power Platform that is more than just a data store option.  This session demystifies what the Common Data Service actually is and how it works.  Learn how CDS evolved from its roots in Dynamics CRM to a central pillar in the Power Platform.  See how using CDS provides security, logic, data, storage and integration features to your Power Platform applications (including Dynamics 365).  Understand how CDS implements the Common Data Model (CDM) and its key advantages over using SharePoint Lists and AzureSQL.
